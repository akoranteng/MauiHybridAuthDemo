# ProductApp — .NET MAUI Blazor Hybrid (Baseline Project)

This repository contains a clean, CLI‑generated **.NET MAUI Blazor Hybrid** application.  
The `main` branch represents the starting point for a step‑by‑step walkthrough that will introduce authentication, role‑based navigation, and hybrid UI patterns in later branches.

This baseline intentionally includes **no custom pages or features yet**.  
It serves as the foundation for all future teaching modules.

## 🌱 Project Creation

This project was created using the .NET CLI:

Using the CLI ensures a reproducible setup and avoids template inconsistencies that sometimes appear in Visual Studio.

## 🧱 Branching Strategy

Each feature will be developed in its own branch to support clear teaching progression and easy comparison.

Planned branches:
01-login-page          → LoginPage.xaml + MVVM bindings 02-auth-service        → AuthService with role tracking 03-main-page           → Product dashboard (Blazor + MAUI) 04-admin-page          → Admin-only UI + role gating 05-navigation-shell    → Shell routing + startup logic
01-login-page          → LoginPage.xaml + MVVM bindings 02-auth-service        → AuthService with role tracking 03-main-page           → Product dashboard (Blazor + MAUI) 04-admin-page          → Admin-only UI + role gating 05-navigation-shell    → Shell routing + startup logic


This structure allows learners to follow the evolution of the app step by step.

## 🎯 Learning Goals

This repository will demonstrate how to:

- Build a MAUI Blazor Hybrid app from a clean baseline  
- Implement MVVM for native MAUI pages  
- Create a login flow with validation  
- Add an authentication service  
- Manage user roles (Admin / User)  
- Navigate between MAUI pages and Blazor components  
- Structure a hybrid application for clarity and maintainability

## 📌 Current Status (main branch)

- ✔️ Clean baseline project  
- ✔️ CLI‑generated  
- ✔️ Ready for feature branches  
- ❌ No authentication yet  
- ❌ No custom pages yet  

This branch is intentionally minimal so each feature can be introduced cleanly in its own module.
